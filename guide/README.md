# The C9 Guide

This is not API documentation, this is a guide-book.

gitbook.

cargo install mdbook




## Plan

- MVP guide covering everything
- Capabilities (what can it actually do)
- Sections: concepts, primitives, decorators, sync/async, custom infrastructure, custom AST transforms
- Testing locally
- Synthesis process
- Deployment process
- Limitations (known issues)


Also do "By Example" sometime soon. Like Rust.
