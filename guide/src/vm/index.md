# The VM

This section is aimed at developers who want to improve Teal, or port it to a
new (cloud) platform, or at anyone who's interested in how Teal works.

*The Teal VM is the main "interesting" and novel contribution in this project.
Teal, the language, does not present anything new -- it's simple an alternative
skin on familiar concepts.*
