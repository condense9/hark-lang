# Machine Design

**Recommended**: Read [From Source to Success](source-to-success.html) first!


## Introduction

Hark ([the language](/language/index.html)) compiles into [bytecode][3] that
runs on a virtual machine designed for *concurrency* and *portability*.

**Concurrency**: When you do `y = async f(x)`, `f(x)` is started in a new thread
(Lambda instance, on AWS). And then when you do `await y`, the current thread
halts, and automatically *continues* when `y` is finished being computed.

**Portability**: Two implementations of this VM exist so farâ€”local and AWS
Lambda, but there's no reason Hark couldn't run on top of (for example)
Kubernetes ([See Issue #8][2]).


## Abstractions

At its core, the VM has two abstractions:

- *Storage*: what does it mean to store/retrieve a value? For example, this is
  done with DynamoDB in AWS.

- *Invocation*: what does it mean to "invoke" a function? In AWS, this is
  currently done with Lambda.
  
These are both *run-time* abstractions, but which could be guided by
compile-time source-code annotations. For example, if some functions have very
high memory requirements, the VM can happily invoke them on an appropriate
instance, while invoking other functions in a smaller instance.

**Implement both of these, and you can run Hark.**

Here's the current implementation landscape.

| Storage   | Invocation      | Platform | Notes                                          |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| In-memory | threading       | Local    | Python threads are not actually concurrent!    |
| DynamoDB  | threading       | Local    | Only useful for testing the DynamoDB storage.  |
| DynamoDB  | multiprocessing | Local    | Concurrent. Use DynamoDB Local.                |
| DynamoDB  | Lambda          | AWS      | Concurrent. Limitations on DynamoDB item size! |
