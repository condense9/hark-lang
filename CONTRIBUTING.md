# Contributing to Hark

Thanks for your interest in Hark, your contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contibute is to submit an issue and help us improve Hark by
telling us what's wrong with it.

If you'd like to write code, the best place to start is the developers section
of the [the Hark guide](https://guide.condense9.com/dev/index.html).

Minimum requirements to develop:
- Docker (to run local DynamoDB instance)
- Poetry (dependencies)

Use `scripts/run_dynamodb_local.sh` to start the local database. Export the
environment variables it gives you - these are required by the Hark runtime.

Hark is very new, and there's *lots* to do. Because it's so new, 
the ways to contribute, or even use Hark, aren't clear yet.

If you're a wizard who can jump right into the codebase and spot
improvements, go ahead and submit a pull request. 

If you're trying something, and it doesn't work, it's very likely to be
a bug - please submit an issue.

Feel free to reach out at any time to Ric directly at ric@condense9.com.
