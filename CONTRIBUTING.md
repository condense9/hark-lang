# Contributing to Teal

Hi! Thanks for your interest in Teal, your contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contibute is to submit an issue.

Teal is very new, and there's *lots* to do. Because it's so new, 
the ways to contribute, or even use Teal, aren't clear yet.

If you're a wizard who can jump right into the codebase and spot
improvements, go ahead and submit a pull request. 

If you're trying something, and it doesn't work, it's very likely to be
a bug - please submit an issue.

Feel free to reach out at any time to Ric directly at ric@condense9.com.
