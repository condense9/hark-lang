# Contributing to Teal

Hi! Thanks for your interest in Teal, your contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contibute is to submit an Issue. There is no issue template,
just dump whatever you'd like into the issue and Ric will get back to you.

Teal is very new, and there's *lots* to do. Because it's so new, 
the ways to contribute, or even use Teal, aren't clear yet.

If you're a wizard who can jump right into the codebase and spot
improvements, go ahead and submit a pull request. Run the tests first
(`make test` at the top level).

If you're trying something, and it doesn't work, it's very likely to be
a bug - please submit an issue.

Feel free to reach out at any time to Ric directly at ric@rmhsilva.com.
