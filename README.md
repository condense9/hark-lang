## The Teal Programming Language

![Tests](https://github.com/condense9/teal-lang/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master) [![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/teal-lang.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/teal-lang)

Teal is a programming language for microservice orchestration. With it, you can 
- get "bare-metal" concurrency on AWS Lambda
- test data pipelines locally
- worry less about building infrastructure

**Teal is alpha quality - unstable, but usable.**

[Play with Teal in your browser!](https://www.condense9.com/playground)

Getting started:

*Do not be afraid, the parentheses will not harm you.*

### Known Limitations and Issues

Only one program file is supported (module/package system coming soon).

There's no error handling. Coming soon!

The tests are pretty much all broken.
