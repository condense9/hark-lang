## The Teal Programming Language

![Build](https://github.com/condense9/teal-lang/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

Teal is a programming language for microservice orchestration. With it, you can 
- get "bare-metal" concurrency on AWS Lambda
- test data pipelines locally
- worry less about building infrastructure

**Teal is alpha quality - unstable, but usable**

Getting started:
- Clone this repository
- `poetry install`
- See [the hello example](examples/hello) to get started

*Do not be afraid, the parentheses will not harm you.*

PyPI package coming soon...


### Known Limitations and Issues

Only one program file is supported (module/package system coming soon).

There's no error handling. Coming soon!

The tests are pretty much all broken.
