# Teal PR Checklist

Thanks so much for your PR! 

Before hitting Create, please check you've covered these points - it'll make the
process much smoother :).

Have you...

- [ ] Run the tests (`make test`, or `pytest --runslow --testddb`)
- [ ] Checked for lint errors (`make lint`, or use the command in `Makefile`)
- [ ] Run the example projects
- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Updated the Teal Guide (optional)


If not, why not?


## Explanation

(Feel free to delete this section - it's just a quick explanation of the
motivation behind the checklist).

### Run the example projects

Take 5 minutes to clone and run the example projects from start to finish, as no
integration test really covers everything!

### Update CHANGELOG.md

Any notable changes should be documented in the CHANGELOG. Friends don't make
friends read git commit logs.

Add a brief description of your change to the "unreleased" section.

### Update the Teal Guide 

If your change is anything other than fixing a bug, please update the Teal Guide
so that people know about your change.
